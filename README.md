# feed-the-animals
// Unity Learn Program's second Prototype Project being a top down Animal Feeding game in a Fruit Ninja style.
- In this project, I programmed a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. In order to do this, I became much more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. In completing this Unit, I learned how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.
- Skills I've learned
Code comprehension
Interpret simple code
Improve simple code using the features of an IDE
Debugging
Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected
Application scripting
Use common logic structures to control the execution of code.
Implement appropriate data types
