# feed-the-animals
// Unity Learn Program's second Prototype Project being a top-down Animal Feeding game in Fruit Ninja style.
- In this project, I programmed a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. In order to do this, I have become much more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. Having completed this Unit, I have learned how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.

Code comprehension
Interpreting simple code
Improving simple code using the features of an IDE
